# Deep Interest Network for Click-Through Rate Prediction<br/>Deep Interest Evolution Network for Click-Through Rate Prediction

Refer to [zhougr1993](https://github.com/zhougr1993/DeepInterestNetwork) and [mouna99](https://github.com/mouna99/dien) code and converte it to TensorFlow 2.0.  
This code performs similarly to the paper on ml-20 and amazon datasets.  
You can modify the ```model``` called in ```main.py``` and then utilize a model such as Base, DIN, DIEN.  

Fork [yongqyu/DIEN-tf2](https://github.com/yongqyu/DIEN-tf2) and [zxxwin/DIEN-tf2](https://github.com/zxxwin/DIEN-tf2).

Requirements:
* python >= 3.6
* tensorflow >= 2.0

1. Run ```data_process.sh``` to download and preprocess the dataset.
2. Run ```python main.py```.
